# On-time Performance Analysis

## Bussiness Context

On-time performance is a crucial Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for every airline, representing the percentage of flights that depart on schedule. Maintaining a high on-time rate not only helps airlines minimize costs associated with delays and operational disruptions but also significantly boosts customer satisfaction.

**Key definition:**

**On-time flights**: A flight is considered on time if it departs or arrives within 15 minutes of the scheduled time, according to industry standards.

**Delay time**: The difference between the actual and scheduled departure or arrival times.

**On-time performance rate**: The percentage of on-time flights, calculated by dividing the number of on-time flights by the total number of flights.

**Analysis questions**:

1/What are the on-time performance trends by month?

2/How does on-time performance vary by the day of the month?

3/What are the trends in on-time performance by the day of the week?

4/How does on-time performance change by the hour of the day?

**Result summary**
The data reveals clear trends to help you make more informed decisions when booking flights. September emerges as the best month for on-time departures, with Saturday being the most reliable day of the week. For those who prefer to avoid delays, booking flights on the 5th, 6th, 15th, 30th, or 31st of the month and opting for morning departures can significantly improve your chances of an on-time flight.
